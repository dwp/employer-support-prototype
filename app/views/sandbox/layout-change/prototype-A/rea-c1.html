    <p class="govuk-body-l">Changes to hours, shift patterns or policies can help your employee do their best at work.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Possible changes could include allowing an employee to start their day later or encouraging regular screen breaks.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to follow these worked examples step by step. Even if the scenario is irrelevant to you, using some of the ideas and processes mentioned will help you support your employee. For example, scheduling regular catch-ups or putting a temporary buddy system in place.</p>

      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p class="govuk-body">An employee was verbally attacked by a customer at the gym they work at.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Following the encounter they:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>felt nervous about coming in for shifts</li>
          <li>were not as welcoming or chatty to customers and colleagues noticed this change in their behaviour</li>
          <li>didn't feel comfortable leading exercise classes alone</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">The gym owner notices a change in the employee. They set up a meeting to discuss possible support. The employer researches mental health awareness courses training to help them understand how best to support staff if this situation were to happen again.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">The employer suggests:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the employee takes a short break from customer-facing tasks</li>
          <li>all staff work in pairs when opening and locking up the gym</li>
          <li>all exercise classes run by individual employees have a buddy (another colleague) observing</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">They agree to meet in a couple of weeks following the changes to discuss if the changes are helping the employee manage their anxiety.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">The employee now feels comfortable running classes and agrees to try leading a session on their own in a couple of weeks. They're also working with a buddy on the front desk one shift per week for a trial period.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What's happening now</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">They now have regular meetings to talk about any issues and to discuss and agree on any changes needed. The employer makes sure that any notes from their meetings are kept private.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The manager notices the change in the employee. They set up a meeting with the employee to explore how they can support them.</p>

          <p class="govuk-body">The employee tells their manager that they are experiencing menopause. They discuss how symptoms are affecting the employee’s role and what options are available to help manage the symptoms at work. They agree to meet again in a week.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">It's agreed that:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>for a trial period, a colleague will cover customer-facing duties when the employee needs to freshen up or take a quick break</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What's happening now</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employee and manager have regular catchups. They discuss how the employee is managing the menopause and if the temporary changes are helping and if any other support is needed.</p>

       </div>
    </details>

   <p class="govuk-body">Consider and agree on each change together with your employee. You should review any changes you make regularly. These are sometimes temporary as health conditions can change over time.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Checking policies</h2>

     <p class="govuk-body">You should refer to any policies you have in place around absences, health and disability, or health and safety. Both temporary and permanent changes could support them.</p>
