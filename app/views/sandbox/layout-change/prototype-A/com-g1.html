      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to say to your employee</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before your conversation, you should check any workplace policy you may have on absence management.</p>


      <p class="govuk-body">Let your employee know you support them but only talk to them about work when they are ready.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use encouraging and supporting language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Would you be comfortable...”</li>
        <li>“Let us know...”</li>

          What not to say
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What not to say</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Try not to put pressure on your employee. Focus on the support they might need. If they have a long-term condition or disability, take care to ask if their absence is related and what that means for them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should not use forceful language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Have you done this task?”</li>
        <li>“When will things be back to normal?”</li>

          How to stay in touch
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to stay in touch</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">There are no rules about how often you get in touch, although you should consider whether you have a workplace policy on this, or any sickness absence procedures. You and your employee should agree how often you will contact each other.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Use whatever method feels most appropriate for you both. For example, it could be an email, phone call or text message.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should avoid creating extra stress or anxiety for your employee. Do not put pressure on them to return to work before they are ready.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping a record of meetings and conversations</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of when you’ve been in touch and what you discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do. It could also help to protect your business if you need to show evidence of communication with your employee about their health condition or disability.</p>
