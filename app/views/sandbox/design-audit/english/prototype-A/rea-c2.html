    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Making changes to the work environment</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">This might include things like desk space, equipment and noise levels. These changes can make the work environment less challenging. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Possible changes could be:
      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>offering a place to work away from distractions to an employee who is feeling overwhelmed by stress</li>
        <li>providing an accessible parking space for an employee who uses mobility aids</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Consider and agree on each change together with your employee. You should review any changes you make regularly Changes are sometimes temporary as health conditions can have different needs over time.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you have workplace policies</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should refer to any policies you have in place around absences, health and disability, or health and safety. Both temporary and permanent changes could support them.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Examples of making changes to the work environment</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If these examples are not relevant to you, you might still be able to use some of the ideas and processes. These might be discussing temporary adjustments or being more sympathetic to employee needs.

      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p class="govuk-body">An employee who was home based had been suffering from a bad back for over a month.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">During a meeting with their employer, the employee mentioned their recent back problems and that they found a new, stylish, top-of-the-range chair online. The employee asked for it to be expensed by the company as they could not afford the chair themselves.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer first wanted to make sure they understood the employee’s needs. They were concerned that the proposed chair did not meet the requirements. The employer also worried about the cost and that everyone else in the company would want one.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">Both met to discuss what the employee had already tried - a back support, a different chair, stretching, advice from their doctor or physiotherapist.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">They agreed that:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the employer would arrange for a desk assessment to be carried out at the employee’s home</li>
          <li>the employer would take advice from the assessment on which chair would be most suitable for the employee’s needs</li>
          <li>the new chair would be within the company's allocated budget allowance</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer makes sure that any notes from their meetings were kept private.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">They met a month later to check if the condition had improved with the new chair and if they needed any more support</p>

      </summary>
      <div class="govuk-details__text">
        <p class="govuk-body">A moderately deaf employee was finding it difficult to concentrate in the open-plan office.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">They found it:</h3>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>tiring to be on video calls with other noises around them distracting them</li>
          <li>difficult fitting an interpreter next to them in the limited space</li>
          <li>awkward as it draws attention to their disability</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer wanted to make sure their employee felt supported and able to carry out their job. They also wanted to check if there was anything else they could do to help the employee overcome their concentration difficulties. </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer checked workplace policies and researched further before having a conversation with the employee.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer suggested moving to a quieter area for a trial period.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">It was less distracting, but the employee felt they:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>were separated from their team</li>
          <li>missed out on team discussions</li>
          <li>wasted time going to and from their team area</li>
          <li>were awkward and that it was unfair they had been separated</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">They agreed to try a partition screen for a trial period. This gave more privacy and fewer distractions. However, there was still not enough space for an interpreter when one was needed.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer swapped the team's area with another team's. This meant the employee was in a quieter space with enough room for an interpreter without being separated from their team.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What's happening now</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">They meet fortnightly to check on the situation and whether the new team location is working for everyone. The employer makes sure that any notes from their meetings are kept private.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">An employee recently completed tests and was waiting for a diagnosis 's' their neurodivergent condition.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer asked for a meeting with the employee as they noticed that in meetings they were:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>not reading the client's body language</li>
          <li>missing conversational cues</li>
          <li>finding it difficult following long meetings</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">Colleagues had also mentioned they thought the employee was distant and unfriendly.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer wanted to make sure they supported the employee effectively. They checked their workplace policies before meeting with the employee.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">They discussed what the employee found difficult or stressful in the workplace. The employee said that they:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>were sensitive to the bright lights and sudden, loud noises in the office</li>
          <li>had difficulty focusing</li>
          <li>found it challenging when colleagues used jargon or metaphors</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">They agreed to put some temporary adjustments in place.</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The employee’s desk was moved from a dark corner of the office to near a window for more natural light</li>
          <li>The employer agreed that the employee could use headphones or earplugs when needed</li>
          <li>Voice recognition software was installed to record long meetings so the employee could listen again to relevant parts</li>
          <li>They worked together to create visual instructions for the office equipment, such as the photocopier and these were displayed on the walls and in a shared folder on the intranet.</li>
          <li>The employee was moved off a high-pressure project for a month</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer also advised the employee to contact Access to Work to see what help could be available.</p>
      
        <p class="govuk-body">They met two weeks later to discuss whether the adjustments were helping. The employer made sure any notes from their meetings were kept private.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What’s happening now</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer gives instructions in various formats until they find the one that works best for the employee. They are also researching neurodiversity awareness training for all employees.</p>
