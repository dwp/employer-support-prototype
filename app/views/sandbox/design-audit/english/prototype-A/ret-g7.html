      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Supporting your employee when they are ready to return to work</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make any changes you agreed before your employee returns to work. There are also some things you can do to help them settle in.</p>

      <!--
        Before employee's first day
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before their first day back at work</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your employee might feel nervous about returning to work, especially if they’ve been off for a long time.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">It can be reassuring for your employee if you plan their first day back. Discuss what they will be doing on their first day and week.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">If your employee isn't working from home, they could find it helpful to make a short visit before their first day back.</p>

       <!--
        What to do in the first week
      -->
      
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">In the first week back at work</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Tell your employee about any changes which affect their work. For example, staff who have joined or left, or new ways of doing things. This conversation will help your employee feel prepared to do their job again.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some employees find it useful to have a ‘buddy’ when they return. A buddy is a trusted colleague who can answer questions and help them settle in.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can find out more guidance on the best practice of <a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/disability/best-practice/sickness-absence.htm" target="_blank">supporting your employee’s sickness absence and return to work on the HSE website (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>

      <!--
        Sharing information
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing information and following the Data Protection Act 2018</h2>

     

      <p class="govuk-body">This covers the management and processing of your employee's personal data, including their health information.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/personal-data-my-employer-can-keep-about-me" target="_blank">See what personal data employers can keep about their employees on GOV.UK (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Getting consent to share information</h3>


      <p class="govuk-body">You must get your employee’s consent before sharing anything that is discussed at your meetings.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Ask your employee if they want other people to know about their condition. If they don't, agree how you will answer questions from colleagues.</p>
