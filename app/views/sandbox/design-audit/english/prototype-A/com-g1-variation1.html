        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Talking to your employee</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Let your employee know you support them but be careful not to pressure them into discussing work until they’re ready. Stress or anxiety could make their health condition or disability worse. </p>
      
      
      <p class="govuk-body">Use encouraging and supporting language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Would you be comfortable..?”</li>
        <li>“Let us know...”</li>
        <li>“Can we arrange..?”</li>
      </ul>

     

      <p class="govuk-body">Focus on the support they might need. If they have a long-term condition or disability, ask if their absence is related and what that means for them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Avoid demanding language such as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>“Have you done this task?”</li>
        <li>“When will things be back to normal?”</li>
        <li>“We need to get you back as quickly as possible”</li>
      </ul>

          How to stay in touch
      -->

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Staying in touch</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You and your employee should agree how often you will contact each other, but take into account any workplace policy on this, or any sickness absence procedures.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should also agree on the best way to contact each other. For example, emails might seem less intrusive but your employee might prefer to speak to you on the phone.</p>

       
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Keeping a record of discussions</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should make a note of the dates of meetings and conversations with your employee and what was discussed. This can be a helpful reminder of what you agreed to do. It could also help to protect your business if you need to show evidence of communication with your employee about their health condition or disability.</p>
