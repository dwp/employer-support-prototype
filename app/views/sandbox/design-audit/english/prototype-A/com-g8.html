      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Ask your employee about a health condition or disability</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can ask your employee about any health condition or disability they have but they do not have to discuss it with you. If you do talk to your employee, make sure you consider their dignity and privacy. Their personal information should be handled confidentially.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Start with a general chat about how they are and how their condition might affect them. Avoid asking for too many details or pushing them to be certain about things too soon.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What 'disability' mean</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Not everyone who meets the definition of disability will think of themselves as disabled.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If your employee has not told you they have a disability, you should still consider any circumstances which suggest they may be disabled and need support.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/definition-of-disability-under-equality-act-2010" target="_blank">Find out what is classed as a disability under the Equality Act 2010 on GOV.UK (opens in new tab)</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If an employee requests no contact</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">As an employer you might need to have some contact to understand:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if the request is because the employee is too unwell or incapacitated to maintain contact</li>
        <li>whether the absence is due to work-related issues or triggers</li>
        <li>what the up-to-date medical position is or to request a fit note</li>
        <li>when it will be appropriate to discuss a return to work plan</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You could agree to reduce contact or to communicate in writing only for an agreed period.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Excessive contact could give an employee grounds to complain of harassment <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/40/contents" target="_blank">under the Protection From Harassment Act 1997 (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
