    <span class="govuk-caption-l">This section: considering adjustments and additional help</span>

    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Discussing extra help</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">It might help your employee to have extra support with parts of their job or how they access work.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">This could be something like giving an employee’s phone duties to a colleague if they have temporary hearing loss.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Consider and agree on each change with your employee and review any changes you make regularly. Changes are sometimes temporary as health conditions can have different needs over time.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Checking policies</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">You should refer to any policies you have in place around absences, health and disability, or health and safety. Both temporary and permanent changes could support them.</p>

    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Example of providing extra help</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If this example is not relevant to you, you might still be able to use some of the ideas and processes. These might be discussing temporary adjustments or being more sympathetic to an employee’s needs.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Select the text below to expand the worked example.</p>

          How an employer supported their employee who'd had a recent cancer diagnosis.
        </span>
      </summary>
      <div class="govuk-details__text">

        <p class="govuk-body">An employee was finding it difficult coming to terms with a cancer diagnosis and was very distracted at work. They needed time off for treatment and consultations. They were also worried about their finances.</p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened first</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employee set up a meeting with their employer to let them know about the diagnosis. They mentioned they planned to keep working during the treatment.</p>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happened next</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer wanted to make sure: </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>they offered the most appropriate support to the employee</li>
          <li>the employee could continue to work effectively</li>
          
        </ul>



        <p class="govuk-body">The employer checked workplace policies around sickness absences and pay and also researched online. They confirmed that employees with a cancer diagnosis are protected from disability-related discrimination under the Equality Act 2010.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer suggested keeping their catch-up meetings to just a few things at a time. This helped to:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>avoid adding extra stress or anxiety for the employee</li>
          <li>keep track of the information, changing circumstances, discussions and decisions made</li>
          <li>only go into as much detail as the employee was comfortable with</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">When the employee’s treatment schedule was confirmed, they met to discuss the plan. They confirmed time off for appointments and to recover from treatment side effects.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The employer suggested they prepare some responses to any questions from colleagues the employee might not be comfortable answering.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Examples of responses could be:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>“I’d rather not talk about it at work.”</li>
          <li>“I’ll let you know when I'm comfortable talking about...”</li>
          <li>“I’m focusing on work at the moment.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What’s happening now</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">They meet to discuss the possible side effects of the treatment and how the employee’s day-to-day routine could be affected.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">They also discuss whether any more adjustments could help the employee do their job effectively.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The employee is worried about the financial implications of having cancer. The employer has consulted the workplace policy and given the employee information on what sick pay is available. They have also advised the employee to contact Access to Work and cancer charities to check what other help and support could be available.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">The employer will continue to support the employee and they'll have regular meetings. They'll discuss what other measures might be available. The employer makes sure that any notes from their meetings are kept private.</p>
