      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Ask your employee about a health condition or disability</h1>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should ask your employee about any health condition  or disability they have. Start with a general chat about how they are. Ask them how their condition might affect them.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Since your employee is currently at work, starting a conversation gives you the best chance to support them. This could reduce the chances that they will need to go off work.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your employee does not have to tell you about their disability or health condition. You should avoid asking for too many details or pushing them to be certain about things too soon.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">When you talk to your employee about their health condition or disability, make sure you consider their dignity and privacy. Their personal information should be handled confidentially.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Not all employees who meet the definition of disability may think of themselves as a ‘disabled person’. Even if your employee has not told you that they have a disability you should consider any circumstances which suggest that they may be disabled and need support.</p>
