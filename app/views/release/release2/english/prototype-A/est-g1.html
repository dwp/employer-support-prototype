      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Paying extra sick pay</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Some employers choose to pay their own sick pay. This is in addition to SSP. If you offer additional sick pay you can decide when to start and stop paying it, and how much to pay.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Asking for medical evidence</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should not ask your employee to provide proof of their health condition or disability from a medical professional.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">After your employee has been off work for 8 days or more you can choose to ask for medical evidence.</p>
